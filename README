This is zedventure, a simple roguelike game written in Python. The object
of the game is never the same, nor is the dungeon. You have only your own
aspirations and skills to guide you. Good luck!

Zedventure is a small game, in terms of the amount of code required. This
game was written from scratch in seven days, inspired by a discussion on
the usenet group rec.games.roguelike.development. The game is designed for
maximum replayability with a modest implementation size and time.
