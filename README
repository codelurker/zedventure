This is zedventure, a simple roguelike game written in Python. The object
of the game is never the same, nor is the dungeon. You have only your own
aspirations and skills to guide you. Good luck!

See the file config.py for the default keybindings. They are similar to
rogue's hjkl movement.

Zedventure is a small game, in terms of the amount of code required. The
first playable version of this game was written from scratch in seven days,
inspired by a discussion on the usenet group rec.games.roguelike.development.
The game is designed for maximum replayability with a modest implementation
size and time.
