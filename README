This is zedventure, a simple roguelike game written in Python. The object
of the game is never the same, nor is the dungeon. You have only your own
aspirations and skills to guide you. Good luck!

See the file config.py for the default keybindings. They are similar to
rogue's hjkl movement.

The first playable version of this game was written from scratch in seven days,
inspired by a discussion on the usenet group rec.games.roguelike.development.
However it has outgrown those restrictions and is now simply a base upon which
I can experiment with game ideas.

Zedventure is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License,
see the LICENSE file for details.
